                                Get involved in our regular theatre play productions and train to become an actor. A theatrical play is 
                                rigorously rehearsed for weeks and demands a balanced mix of acting, voice control, movement and 
                                stage sense. And a live performance is that special, magic ingredient in the recipe for grooming 
                                one’s acting talent. It is well known that the longevity of any actor, across different media, 
                                has been rooted in his theatre experience.We are willing to offer this at minimal charge. 
                                Only because we expect something far more valuable from you – your dedication, involvement 
                                and ability to have fun. We believe that good theater (and art in general) is an essential 
                                component of societal wellbeing. We are committed to reviving amateur theatre activity in the region,
                                 just for the sheer joy of it. Naturally, we invite all sections of society (irrespective of age, gender, 
                                 education, acting prowess) to join us in this endeavor. All we are looking for is zeal, time to spare and openness to 
                                 enjoy the ride.

                        Theatre has always been a strong medium for social integration and upliftment. 
                        It has been an effective vehicle for increasing the awareness on various social issues. 
                        Theater is economical, portable and adaptable to cultural sensitivities. It can gauge the
                         reactions of the audience and engage with them in a live environment. 
                         Clearly, theatre is an ideal platform for NGOs to take their work forward.
                          Bhoomika has created the tools and possesses the experience to facilitate the promotion
                           of social causes through theatre.

                            From teaching to theatre – is it really feasible? Well, that is what we 
                            have done in the past, with much success. We can train the teachers of your
                             school in the process of a play production so that the children can put up 
                             a strong show (literally!) that will delight the children, the teachers and 
                             the parents alike. Of course, the outcomes go far beyond the stage, as these
                              activities can help foster the student-teacher relationships and improve the
                              quality of imparting education.
